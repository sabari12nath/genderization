# Genderization üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: ByteBeards

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sabarinath ps , SNMIMT

### Project Description
A hilariously over-engineered AI tool that takes your photo and predicts whether you look male or female ‚Äî because nothing says ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù like reinventing the obvious. Powered by a PyTorch model (or pure randomness for extra spice).

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes you wake up, look in the mirror, and think, *"Hmm‚Ä¶ am I me today?"*  
Or maybe you just want a computer to confirm what you already know.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Upload your photo, hit **Analyze**, and let our AI deliver a confident verdict.  
Is it useful? Not at all. Is it entertaining? Absolutely.
